#Customer intent: As a developer, I need to prepare install the prerequisites to enable service fabric mesh development in visual studio.

# Set up your Windows development environment to build Service Fabric applications

To build and run Azure Service Fabric apps on your Windows development machine, install the Service Fabric runtime, SDK, and tools.

[!INCLUDE [preview note](./includes/include-preview-note.md)]

## Supported operating system versions

The following operating system versions are supported for development:

* Windows 10 (Enterprise, Professional, or Education)
* Windows Server 2016

## Enable Hyper-V

Hyper-V must be enabled for you to create Service Fabric apps. 

### Windows 10

Open PowerShell as an administrator and run the following command:

```powershell
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V -All
```

Restart your computer. For more information about how to enable Hyper-V, see [Install Hyper-V on Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v).

### Windows Server 2016

Open PowerShell as an administrator and run the following command:

```powershell
Install-WindowsFeature -Name Hyper-V -IncludeManagementTools
```

Restart your computer. For more information about how to enable Hyper-V, see [Install the Hyper-V role on Windows Server 2016](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/get-started/install-the-hyper-v-role-on-windows-server).

## Visual Studio

Visual Studio 2017 is required to deploy Service Fabric apps. [Install version 15.6.0][download-visual-studio] or greater and enable the following workloads:

- ASP.NET and web development
- Azure Development

## Docker

Install Docker to support the containerized Service Fabric apps used by Service Fabric Mesh.

### Windows 10

Download and install the latest version of [Docker Community Edition for Windows][download-docker]. 

During the installation, select **Use Windows containers instead of Linux containers** when asked. You'll need to then sign out and sign back in. After signing back in, if you did not previously enable Hyper-V, you may be prompted to enable Hyper-V. You must enable Hyper-V and then restart your computer.

After your computer has restarted, Docker will prompt you to enable the **Containers** feature, enable it, and restart your computer.

### Windows Server 2016

Use the following PowerShell commands to install Docker. For more information, see [Docker Enterprise Edition for Windows Server][download-docker-server].

```powershell
Install-Module DockerMsftProvider -Force
Install-Package Docker -ProviderName DockerMsftProvider -Force
Install-WindowsFeature Containers
```

Restart your computer.

## SDK and tools

Install the Service Fabric runtime, SDK, and tools in a dependent order.

1. Install the [Microsoft Azure Service Fabric SDK and runtime][download-sdk] using Web Platform Installer.
2. Install the [Service Fabric Mesh SDK][download-sdkmesh] using Web Platform Installer.
4. Install the [Visual Studio Service Fabric Tools (preview) extension][download-tools] from Visual Studio Marketplace.

## Build a cluster

For the best debugging performance when you create and run Service Fabric apps, we recommend creating a single-node local development cluster. This cluster must be running whenever you deploy or debug a Service Fabric Mesh project.

Docker **must** be running before you can build a cluster. Test that Docker is running by opening a terminal window and running `docker ps` to see if an error occurs. If the response does not indicate an error, Docker is running and you're ready to build a cluster.

After you install the runtime, SDKs, and Visual Studio tools, create a development cluster.

1. Close your PowerShell window.
2. Open a new, elevated PowerShell window as an administrator. This step is necessary to load the Service Fabric modules you installed.
3. Run the following PowerShell command to create a development cluster:

    ```powershell
    . "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Service Fabric\ClusterSetup\DevClusterSetup.ps1" -CreateOneNodeCluster -UseMachineName
    ```

4. To start the local cluster manager tool, run the following PowerShell command:

    ```powershell
    . "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Service Fabric\Tools\ServiceFabricLocalClusterManager\ServiceFabricLocalClusterManager.exe"
    ```

You're now ready to create Service Fabric Mesh applications!
